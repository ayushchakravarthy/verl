If I combine these, maybe there's a way to use meta learning in the context of prompt-based models. Like, instead of just using fixed prompts, the model could learn how to generate better prompts by considering the performance on the task. That way, the prompt generation itself becomes part of the learning process, similar to how the teacher in MetaDistil learns from the student. This could lead to more efficient and adaptive prompt strategies that automatically adjust based on task outcomes, enhancing both the student's performance and the prompt's effectiveness. That's an insight that comes from connecting both papers' ideas.\n",
